# OpenSearch Data Indices and Lifecycle

## Index Format
nrm - (type) - (qualifier) .(lifecycle) - (date splitter)

| Part          	| Usage    	| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	|
|---------------	|----------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| type          	| Required 	| The generic type of the documents. In the best case scenario, this is sufficient to determine the fields and lifecycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	|
| qualifier     	| Optional 	| Used when the type is insufficient to determine the fields required for the index. An example is an audit log for an application. As this varies per application, 'nrm-audit' is insufficiently specific. Another example is a subtype where a group of applications may require more (or just different) fields compared to the generic type.  	|
| lifecycle     	| Avoid    	| Lifecycle should only ever be used in extreme cases where a large portion of the documents stored in the type/qualifier must be deleted much earlier than the standard lifecycle for the type/qualifier combo allows. Really avoid multiple lifecycles on a single index name.                                                                  	|
| date splitter 	| Required 	| This is usually the year-month-day or year-month. The splitter used is largely up to how much data is incoming and the lifecycle. (You can't delete an index split monthly on a weekly schedule for example.)                                                                                                                                   	|

The 'nrm - (type) - (qualifier)' portion (or without the qualifier) will be referred to as the index name, below.

Aliases: The index name is always an alias as well.

## Index Lifecycle
Generally, fresher data is examined more often so more resources are utilized to make that faster. All indices start on hot data nodes. 

| Index Name           | Performance | Scale Down at | Merge at | Warm at | Delete at | Rollup |
|----------------------|-------------|---------------|----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| nrm-access-external  |             |               | 5 weeks  | 40 days | Unknown   | No     |
| nrm-access-internal  |             |               | 7 days   | 10 days | 4 weeks   | No     |
| nrm-app-generic      |             |               | 7 days   | 10 days | 2 weeks   | No     |
| nrm-audit-broker     |             |               | 2 days   | 10 days | Years?    | No     |
| nrm-audit-mq         |             |               | 7 days   | 10 days | 4 weeks   | No     |
| nrm-audit-vault      |             |               | 40 days  | 45 days | Years?    | No     |
| nrm-deploy           |             |               | 40 days  | 45 days | No        | No     |
| nrm-metrics          |             |               | 2 days   | 4 days  | 4 weeks   | No     |
| nrm-tomcat-catalina  |             |               | 7 days   | 10 days | 2 weeks   | No     |
| nrm-tomcat-localhost |             |               | 7 days   | 10 days | 2 weeks   | No     |

### Column notes
- Performance: The increase in replica count initially to boost it. All indexes have a single replica (and a single primary).
- Scale down at: When the increase in replica count is reduced to save storage space
- Merge at: When a 'force_merge' occurs that renders the index read-only and optimizes storage. This means logs older than this can not be loaded (easily).
- Warm at: When the index is transitioned for hot to warm data nodes (with expected decrease in performance)
- Delete at: When the index is removed.
- Rollup: Are stats from the indices rolled up into another index for indefinite usage?

## Dead Letter Lifecycle
Records that fail to be committed to an OpenSearch Index for any reason are added to the dead letter queue (AWS Kinesis Firehose) that outputs to an s3 bucket. The s3 bucket deletes the data after 7 days.

## Appendix
Explanation of why certain qualifiers are used or not

| Type  | Qualifier | Description                                                                                                        |
|-------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| app   | (blank)   | Never. Types of applications are encouraged to group themselves into generic types.                                |
| app   | (appname) | Applications will be permitted their own index provided they are extracting unique fields from their log messages. |
| audit | (blank)   | Never. Audit logs are specific to an application so a generic type would not make sense.                           |

## How to create an alias
Assume: '- (date splitter)' on end of the pattern

| Pattern(s)                    | Alias                      | Description                                                       |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| nrm - (type)...               | nrm - (type)               |                                                                   |
| nrm - (type) - (qualifier)... | nrm - (type)               | Qualified types may use the generic type alias if it makes sense. |
|                               | nrm - (type) - (qualifier) |                                                                   |
| ... .(lifecycle) ...          | See above                  | Lifecycle should not change alias.                                |

All non-exploratory indices must have a strict dynamic mapping. The type of logs that are sent should be well understood and described. This means no additional fields are added 

## Standard Lifecycle Modifiers
These modifiers are for edge cases where the long term cost of a subset of the data greatly outweighs the utility of keeping it around. Lifecycle modifiers are not recommended because fewer indices decreases the overall data size and speeds query response. A fair bit of analysis should go into any decision to use one. 

| Modifier | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| preprod  | This is used to split non-production data from the production data. This split will be determined by the service.environment field. This can be used where there is a large volume of non-production data mixed with production data. Production data will have no modifier. |
