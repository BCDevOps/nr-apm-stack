# OpenSearch Common Schema
"A common schema helps correlate data from sources like logs and metrics or IT operations analytics and security analytics".

Reference: [Elastic Common Schema](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html)

## Current User Cases
- Access Logs
- Audit Logs
    - NR Broker
    - Vault
- Application Logs
- CPU Metrics
- Deployment Metrics (Superseded by NR Broker Audit)
- Disk Usage Metrics
- Memory Usage Metrics
- Tomcat Access Logs
All these use cases have index naming patterns that must be adhered to. The naming pattern allows us to utilize [index templates](https://github.com/BCDevOps/nr-apm-stack/tree/main/workflow-cli/configuration-opensearch/index_template) to define the schema for the use case and policies to manage their lifecycle. All new use cases will start with the creation of a new index template and associated lifecycle.

## Style
- Lower case for static/constant values

## Field Reference

### Base Fields
| Field                    | Mandatory | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Values |
|--------------------------|-----------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| [@timestamp](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-base.html#field-timestamp)               |     :bulb:     | date    | The date/time when the event/metric/alert took place                                                                                                                                                                                                       |        |
| message                  |     :bulb:     | keyword | Unstructured human readable text that provides details of the event. Things like the timestamp, error level and others should not appear here as it would duplicate those fields.                                                                          |        |
| labels.environment_alias |    :bulb:/#    | keyword | On traditional infrastructure, environments have been referred to in code and by developers by environment names specific to groups of applications. The lambda parser 'EnvironmentStandardizeParser' should be used to populate this field automatically. | wfint  |
| labels.project           |     :bulb:     | keyword | A business grouping of services (or components). This has been referred to as the application. Used in conjunction with the service. Related: service.name                                                                                                 |        |
| labels.target_project    |     :bulb:     | keyword | A business grouping of services (or components). Used in conjunction with the service.target. Related: service.target                                                                                                                                      |        |

Note on labels: Data is imported using index templates with strict turned on. So, the custom keys in labels (examples: environment_alias, project) must be defined in the index template. Labels will only be added in the unlikely case that ECS does not have a field for the data and the label adds unique value to the document.

Note on tags: These will likely not be used.

| cloud.region   |           |      |             | - bcgov - calgary - kamloops |

### Client Fields
Recommendation: Use [Source Fields](https://apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/int/confluence/display/1TEAM/Common+Schema#CommonSchema-source-fields)

Client fields are for adding semantic context to an exchange. Generally, this is not necessary and/or a duplication.

| service.environment |     :bulb:     | keyword | This field is expected to be normalized across all applications and platforms to allow comparison (wildfire, SMT, OCP, AWS, etc.). The lambda parser 'EnvironmentStandardizeParser' should be used to do this normalization. It will populate the field labels.environment_alias with the originally sent value if it is not a normalized one. Examples: service.environment is production → No changes needed. labels.environment_alias is not set. Use of EnvironmentStandardizeParser is suggested (in case other data is not normalized) but not required.  service.environment is wfint → service.environment altered to integration. labels.environment_alias is set to wfint.

#### Which service to use?
There are three service objects defined in the ECS. It can be a bit confusing which field to use. The ECS provides some minimal guidance. Basically, it breaks down to:

- service: What made the log
- service.origin: What caused the log
- service.target: Who is the log for

Examples

| Index               | Source                     | service              | service.origin                           | service.target                                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| nrm-access-external | Smarties/skittles          | apache reverse proxy | None. Usually a random user on internet. | What was sent the request and responded.                        |
|                     | OCP App                    | OCP App              | None. Usually a random user on internet. | None if the service logging also responded.                     |
| nrm-audit-vault     | Knox (IIT Hashicorp Vault) | Knox                 | None. Usually a random user on internet. | Set if the path called reveals which service this audit is for. |

### Server Fields
Recommendation: Use [Destination Fields](https://apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/int/confluence/display/1TEAM/Common+Schema#CommonSchema-destination-fields)

Server fields are for adding semantic context to an exchange. Generally, this is not necessary and/or a duplication.

### Source Fields
| Field       | Mandatory | Type   | Description                                                          | Values |
|-------------|-----------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| [source.user](https://apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/int/confluence/display/1TEAM/Common+Schema#CommonSchema-user-fields) |           | object | If the source is associated a user, source.user should be populated. |        |

Reference: [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-source.html](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-source.html)

### TLS Fields
Reference: [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-tls.html](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-tls.html)

### URL Fields
| Field       | Mandatory | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                           | Values |
|-------------|-----------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| url.context |           | keyword | The path prefix used to distinguish how traffic is treated/routed. This should only be used with access requests going through a single domain that is used by multiple applications. | /int   |

Reference: [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-url.html](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-url.html)

### User Agent Fields
| Field                      | Mandatory | Type    | Description | Value  |
|----------------------------|-----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| user_agent.device.type   |           | keyword |             | mobile |
| user_agent.device.vendor |           | keyword |             | Apple  |

Reference: [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-user_agent.html](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-user_agent.html)

### User Fields
If the user is associated with the source or destination then it should be populated under those fields.

Reference: [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-user.html](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-user.html)

### Elastic Search Metadata fields
| Field  | Description                                                                                          |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _id    | The unique id of the record in the index. This should be derived from record and static if possible. |
| _type  | It is deprecated, but the valued "_doc" must be provided                                             |
| _index | The index the data is added to                                                                       |
