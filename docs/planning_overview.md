Your application's events will go on a journey from being created, sent over HTTP to AWS, parsed by a Lambda function and finally added to OpenSearch. The creation of suitable event documents and sending them to add to OpenSearch is your team's responsibility. Your team should explore what are the valuable events in your application, how you will dispatch the events, what are your data management requirements, and how you plan on forwarding the events to OpenSearch.

It is also your team's responsibility that the documents stored in OpenSearch can be correlated with other logs. You are free to internally call your production environment a fun name like "RazzleDazzle." But, if you send that as the environment values your logs won't show up when someone searches for the infinitely more boring "production." The same problem occurs if you put that environment value in a non-standard field. This is partly handled by the strict schema used by each of the index patterns. Your team should explore the existing schemas and the values stored in OpenSearch.

We can provide advice and examples of how teams have successfully made their application's events in OpenSearch. We can also assist with how to go from an event to an event document that fits existing schemas and has data values consistent with other applications in your event documents.
